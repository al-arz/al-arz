Hi there! I'm Pavel. Often appearing as **Al Arz** on the Internet.

I used to play games a lot. Now I'm making them.
I've been programming games since school. Doing it professionaly (= getting paid) for the web since 2019. Worked in a startup, in a big company, in a small company, you get it.

I'm most proficinet with JavaScript, TypeScript and Haxe. Dabbled with many other languanges as well.

Right now I'm learning (and re-learning) a bunch of things I somehow missed in the past years. Mostly "regular" frontend, but also things like how does V8 JIT-compilation work or when does pixi.js batch the sprites its rendering, etc.

Also finishing my own game while **looking for a new job**.
