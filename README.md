Hi there! I'm Pavel. Often appearing as **Al Arz** on the Internet.

I used to play games a lot. Now I'm making them.
I've been programming games since school. Doing it professionaly (= getting paid) for the web since 2019. Worked in a startup, in a big company, in a small company, you get it.

I'm most proficient with JavaScript, TypeScript and Haxe. Dabbled with many other languanges as well.

Learning how to be a better programmer and a game designer.
